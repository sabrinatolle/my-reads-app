# MyReads Project

A bookshelf app created with ReactJS that allows user to select and categorize books that you have read, are currently reading or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

# Requirements
 - npm 

## Installation 

To get started : 
* [Download](https://github.com/sabrinatolle/my-reads-app.git) or [clone](https://github.com/sabrinatolle/my-reads-app.git) the repository.
* Run `npm install`  to install the project dependencies.
* start the server with `npm start`.
* App will appear at: `localhost:3000`.




## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
